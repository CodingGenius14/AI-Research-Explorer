AI Usage:

Tools: ChatGpt | Github Copilot - Claude Opus 4.6 - plan, ask, agent

ChatGpt - Used to ensure that I was setting up supabase correctly regarding the tables and pgvector within the SQL editor

Github Copilot - Plan: Used to plan the development process for the machine learning recommending system by deciding where to write the code, the model to use,
and setting up the function templates in recommender.py

Github Copilot - Ask: Constantly asking to check whether the code I implemented in recommender.py and main.py were correct and functioned the way I intended them to.
And whether or not the code would work if I were to push it to production based on the free tier with render and vercel

Github Copilot - Agent: Used extensively to revamp the code in the frontend to improve the UI of the web app, debugging, and used within recommender.py to 
set up the ONNX runtime code

Main Prompts:

General:
- I have a web app that allows users to search and save papers to a library through the arXiv api, my goal is to add a recommendation feature on the home page of the
app that recommends research papers to a user based on the papers they have saved in their library, create a set of instructions that I need to follow to implement
this feature. I'm using React for the frontend, FastAPI for the backend, and Supabase as my database
- What are additional UI features I can add to my web app that would make it more useful and also more visually appealing

FastAPI:
- In @app.post("/api/search-papers") within main.py, I want all the search results based on the user's querry to be added to the 'papers' table within Supabase if 
they aren't already apart of the table
- Currently it is taking too much time for the searches to load because the embeddings are being calculated during the search, implement a way for the search results
to display faster and still handle the embedding generation with main.py

Supabase:
- In my Supabase 'papers' table, I created a new column called embeddings (vector) which is going to store the embedding vector for each research paper in the table,
help me setup the SQL Editor for cosine similarity with pgvector

ML Recommender:
- In recommender.py create a template where you only create the name of the functions and instructions for each function for I can implement the code myself
- I am currently using Sentence-Transformer to run my model but it is using too much memory and that is going to intefere with the free tier of render when I deploy 
the backend, what are other alternatives to Sentence-Transformer
- Remove Sentence-Transformers from recommender.py and implement the changes needed to use ONNX runtime to save memory

Frontend:
- Currently the color scheme of the web app looks unprofessional, since the intended audience for this web app are college students, proffessors, and researchers 
create a more approporiate color scheme utilziing darker colors for the background and lighter colors for text and effects that will make the web app have a 
professional, modern looking, visually appealing design to it
- Use framer motion to add smooth ui animations into the web app
- remake landing page to display more information about the web app and include the core functionalities of the app (search papers, save papers, recommendations)
